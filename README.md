# For-Data-Science-IBM-Course
A repository for projects and files related to the Data Science IBM course on Coursera

Added a file with practicing Dash(and therefore interactive applications). each application should open in a separate window.
It is assumed that apart from the dash library all other used libraries are downloaded(pandas, numpy, plotly.express etc). If not please run
!pip install <corresponding_library_name> for each library you don't have
